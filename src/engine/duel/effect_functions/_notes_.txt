; General Notes
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It seems that, in many Pokémon sets, at least for Evolved Pokémon, there is a
10 point bonus for 3-energy attacks and a 20-point bonus for 4-energy attacks.

Spread damage to full Bench seems to be valued at 25 or 30 points.


Poison should be valued somewhere between 5 and 10 points.
Burn should be valued at 15 points.
Paralysis should be valued between 15 and 20 points.
Sleep should be valued at 15 points.
Confusion should be valued at 15 points.
