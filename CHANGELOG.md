### Miscellaneous

#### Game Mechanics

#### Options

- Changed default text speed to fastest.

#### AI

- Some decks did not consider retreating at all. This was fixed.
- Some non-Boss decks had a 25% chance of not using Trainer cards or Pokémon Powers, while a select few had a 50% chance. This was normalized to a 12.5% chance for all non-Boss decks.
- Various improvements to the AI's logic regarding energy attachment.

#### Deck Building

## Version 0.1

### Added
- Darkness type.
- Card: Darkness Basic Energy.
- Implemented Supporter Trainer cards.

- Changed Pokémon types, weaknesses and resistances to accommodate the new Darkness type and to better distribute weakness and resistance ratios per type.
- **Ekans** and **Arbok**: changed type to Darkness and weakness to Fighting.
- **Nidoran (F)**, **Nidorina**, **Nidoran (M)** and **Nidorino**: changed type to Darkness and weakness to Fighting.
- **Nidoqueen** and **Nidoking**: changed type to Darkness, weakness to Fighting and resistance to Lightning.
- **Zubat** and **Golbat**: changed type to Darkness and weakness to Lightning.
- **Grimer** and **Muk**: changed type to Darkness and weakness to Fighting.
- **Koffing** and **Weezing**: changed type to Darkness and weakness to Fighting.

- **Jigglypuff** and **Wigglytuff**: changed type to Psychic, weakness to Darkness and removed resistance to Psychic.
- **Rattata**, **Raticate**, **Meowth**, **Persian**, **Lickitung**, **Chansey**, **Kangaskhan**, **Tauros**, **Ditto**, **Eevee**, **Porygon**, **Snorlax**, **Dratini** and **Dragonair**: removed resistance to Psychic.

- **Gyarados**: changed weakness to Lightning.
- **Geodude**, **Graveler** and **Golem**: added resistance to Lightning.
- **Onix**: added resistance to Lightning.
- **Aerodactyl**: changed weakness to Water.
- Updated AI decks to include appropriate energy cards.
- Evolving Pokémon no longer clears status conditions.
- Retreating no longer clears status conditions.
- Paralysis, Sleep and Confusion allow for a normal retreat.
- Poison and Sleep remain on benched Pokémon, but no damage is taken from Poison, and Pokémon do not wake up on the Bench.
- Sleep works similarly to Confusion; a coin is flipped before attacking in order to determine whether the Pokémon wakes up.
- Poison only deals damage on the Pokémon owner's turn.
- Confusion only deals 10 damage to self on tails.
- A player can only retreat once per turn.
- In the first turn of the game, a player can only either Attack or use a Supporter card.
- Changed the following cards to be Trainer Supporter cards: **Professor Oak**, **Imposter Professor Oak**, **Bill**, **Mr. Fuji**, **Lass**, **Pokémon Trader**, **Energy Retrieval**, **Super Energy Retrieval**, **Energy Removal**, **Super Energy Removal**, **Switch**, **Pokémon Center**, **Scoop Up**, **Computer Search**, **Item Finder**, **Gust of Wind**.
- **Bill**: draws 3 cards.
- **Potion**: heals 30 HP.
- **Super Potion**: heals 60 HP.
- **Revive**: revives a Pokémon with full HP.
- Adjusted the retreat costs of many Pokémon to keep most Basic Pokémon at 0 cost, most Stage 1 at 1 COLORLESS and some Stage 2 or other heavy attackers at 2 COLORLESS.

### Fixed
- AI wrongfully adds score twice for attaching energy to Arena card.
- Cards in AI decks that are not supposed to be placed as Prize cards are ignored.
- AI score modifiers for retreating are never used.
- AI handles Basic Pokémon cards in hand wrong when scoring the use of Professor Oak.
- Rick never plays Energy Search.
- Rick uses wrong Pokédex AI subroutine.
- Chris never uses Revive on Kangaskhan.
- AI Pokemon Trader may result in unintended effects.
- Sam's practice deck does wrong card ID check.
- AI does not account for Mysterious Fossil or Clefairy Doll when using Shift Pkmn Power.
- Challenge host uses wrong name for the first rival.

### To Do
- Simplify custom logic (`OATS`) for card filters in `deck_configuration.asm`. Trainer filter already handles Trainer cards, no need to check for Trainer in Pokémon/Energy filters.
